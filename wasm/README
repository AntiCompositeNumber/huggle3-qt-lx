This folder contains scripts and code needed to compile Huggle into WebAssembly

Resources:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Concepts
* https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_WebAssembly

Qt only support qmake for WASM building so there is a special .pro file in build folder
that encapsulates all Huggle source code files and that can be used to build it
